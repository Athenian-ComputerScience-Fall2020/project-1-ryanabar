### Criteria

Your program should include a minimum of:

* 1 list (3 or more elements)
* manipulation of the list in some way
* 1 while loop
* 1 conditional (if-elif-else)
* 1 for loop
* 1 function that does something other than just print
* function should be called at least 2x
* 2 types of variables
* Try/except
* Comments - use them!
* Collaborators (as usual)

### Pseduocode
You also have to draw up some sort of outline for your program. Whether you 
choose to draw a diagram, or would like to have an bullet-point list, an outline 
is a great way to track what you are doing in each step of your program.


### Suggestions
*   Use two functions
*   Make sure your program is fluid, as though it's an actual human talking
*   Comments are a great way to keep track of your code.
